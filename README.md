# Two articles about Global Warming Data
## Article One:
## [**Feds release bleak 2022 climate change data: Oceans warm, global temps among hottest on record**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/13/noaa-nasa-release-2022-climate-change-data-disasters-temperatures/11031679002/)

The arthor divided this article in four parts: 

1. **Oceans get even warmer and saltier**


2.  **World temperatures again among warmest on record**
3. **18 billion-dollar disasters in US**
4. **How did US weather in 2022 compare to previous years?**

## In the first part,
the author shows the global highest temperature in the whole year and shows it into a graph: [NASA map](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/01/12/USAT/d161d49d-f863-4943-afec-70d97eb0f52c-NASA_warming_despite_La_Nina.png?width=660&height=474&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp)

## In the Second part, 
the author shows how the global temperature shift during hundred of years, and represent it into a [scatter point diagram](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/01/12/USAT/31feac05-ea85-42b1-a916-c1da4bd43ae6-2022_sixth_warmest.png?width=660&height=489&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp)

## In the third part, 
the author points out that disaster caused by Global warming causes **165 billion Dollars** loss for America, and causes **474 death**.

## In the fourth part, 
the author points out several typical data to represent severity global warming problem caused to the US.

## Article 2:
## [**2022 in Review: Global Temperature**](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/2022-in-review-global-temperature)

The arthor divided this article in three parts: 

1. **2022 was the planet’s sixth hottest year on record, averaging NASA and NOAA’s year-end analyses.**


2.  **The planet is heating up**
* The planet is heating up—even during a cooling phase. 
* The planet is heating up—especially in the coldest places. 
* The planet is heating up—earning another dark red stripe.
3. **Solutions ahead**

## In the first part, 
the author gives a [diagram showing 10 hottest global years](https://images.ctfassets.net/cxgxgstp8r5d/48O9NSHlMRDFfJb6vnfI1g/291d313ca5bfa709f01d3807cef229de/20222023GlobalTemps_Top10_en_title_lg.jpg?w=3840), representing that 2022 is the world 6th hottest year.

## In the second part, 
the author gives two diagrams: [change in global temperature](https://images.ctfassets.net/cxgxgstp8r5d/568xOrNdAWSKSs03kwRSwb/17e04a94241d0605240b665bc43eddfc/20222023GlobalTemps_Anomalies_en_title_lg.jpg?w=3840) and [2022 global warming stripes](https://images.ctfassets.net/cxgxgstp8r5d/5FA9wnstcPDbZBuu24uVwy/96a34eca571e2e66d478774901613b82/2023GlobalTemps_Stripes_en_title_lg.jpg?w=3840). The first diagram shows how global warming arises the global temperature and the second diagram shows how global warming problem even badly influence the coldest area of the earth.

## In the third part, 
the author talks about how people react and enforce the policies to religate the global warming.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, global warming has proven to be a severe problem people have to face. 2022 has recorded to be 6th hottest year in the history. And the global warming will cause disasters to human-being. It is time for us to be alarmed and try to help our earth!
